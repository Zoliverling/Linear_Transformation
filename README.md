# Fourier Transformer

## Introduction
This project aims to harness the power of the Fourier transformer, a variant of the linear transformer architecture, to predict stock prices. 
Utilizing advanced techniques in machine learning and signal processing, the Fourier transformer model in this project tackles the challenges of financial time-series forecasting. 
By transforming time-series data into the frequency domain, the model captures underlying patterns and trends that are essential for accurate predictions.

## Motivation
Financial markets are known for their volatility and unpredictability. 
Investors and analysts strive to predict market movements to make informed decisions, but traditional models often fall short in handling the complexity and noise inherent in stock price data. 
The Fourier transformer offers a promising solution by simplifying the computational complexity of traditional transformers while retaining their predictive power. 
This approach is particularly suited to processing long sequences of historical data, which is typical in stock market analysis.

The motivation for developing this project is twofold:
1. **Enhanced Prediction Accuracy:** By leveraging the Fourier transformer, this model aims to improve the accuracy of stock price forecasts, benefiting from the transformer's ability to manage long data sequences without the computational overhead of standard attention mechanisms.
2. **Real-time Processing Capability:** With increased efficiency, the model can process and predict stock prices in near real-time, a critical requirement for trading algorithms and investment strategies that rely on timely data.
